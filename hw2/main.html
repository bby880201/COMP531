							<h2>Strategy</h2>
							<p>Due to their reasonably low mana cost, building a deck around Murloc cards can give you a very early board advantage by overwhelming your opponent with minions. Early game dominance and setting up your Murloc army will be your main objective. Most Murloc cards benefit from having other Murlocs on the field with them. For example, you could play Murloc Tidecaller and then Murloc Tidehunter in order to turn your Murloc Tidecaller into a 3/2 minion instead of a 1/2. Many other combinations exist as well.</p>
							<p>Many classes can lend their unique strengths to the Murloc deck:</p>
							<p>The Shaman class possesses highly efficient removal spells; Rockbiter Weapon, Stormforged Axe and Lightning Bolt can keep the board clear, while Earth Shock and Hex gets rid of Taunt and other threats. In addition, Bloodlust serves as an excellent finisher that synergizes with the swarming nature of murloc decks. Shaman are also one of the only two classes to have class-specific cards that have synergy with Murlocs (Siltfin Spiritwalker, Neptulon and Everyfin is Awesome).</p>
							<p>Paladins can work favorably with aggro decks, buffing their murlocs with cheap spells such as Blessing of Might to pile on damage, buff them in bulk with cards such as Sword of Justice and Competitive Spirit, while also trading with other minions with Divine Shield. Paladins are also one of two classes to have class-specific Murloc synergy cards, bring even more murlocs on board with Murloc Knight, Vilefin Inquisitor, and Anyfin Can Happen.</p>
							<p>Warlock Murloc decks (known as "Murlock" decks) are highly popular because of their Life Tap ability. This allows them to draw more cards and fill their board with Murlocs in the same manner as zoo decks, speeding up a Murloc deck's ramp up time. Voidwalker and Blood Imp are a strong early defense to keep Murlocs alive, while Soulfire and Shadow Bolt provide cheap removal of enemy threats.</p>
							<p>Druids have the signature spell Innervate that will allow the Druid to put out more Murlocs in the early game, have Power of the Wild and Mark of the Wild to buff their Murlocs cheaply, and have Wrath, Claw and Naturalize for cheap removal. Moreover, since the finisher Savage Roar is relatively cheap, it can be played twice in a turn for large damage burst before their opponent can stabilize.</p>
							<p>Minions and spells that buff or are more useful with more minions on the field synergize well with Murloc decks such as Raid Leader, Reliquary Seeker, and Frostwolf Warlord.</p>

							<h2>Counters</h2>
							<p>Spells that target all enemies, such as Arcane Explosion, Fan of Knives or other field-wide damage cards, are strong against Murloc decks due to their low health and swarm nature. Taunt cards are useful against Murloc decks because they force the Murlocs to attack them before your hero can be targeted, possibly dying in the process.</p>
							<p>It is recommended to remove any Murloc on the field as soon as possible, especially high priority targets such as Murloc Warleader or Murloc Tidecaller, because of the increasing difficulty in killing Murlocs as more and more are put on the field. Be sure not to exhaust your options too early; using a Blizzard or Consecration on only a few Murlocs may leave you defenseless when they summon even more. Gauge the situation and see if waiting a turn is the better option.</p>
							<p>Priests can effectively counter Murlocs by having Northshire Clerics early out and buffing them with Power Word: Shield. After that they can clear weak Murlocs using Clerics and heal Clerics for good card sustain and suffocating Murloc player.</p>
							<p>Also, Hungry Crab is a direct early-game counter to Murlocs. If played early enough, its ability to destroy a Murloc when summoned plus the subsequent attack and health buff could be used to halt a Murloc deck from snowballing past its initial phases. If you know you will be going up against a Murloc deck, adding two Hungry Crabs should make it much easier to deal with.</p>
