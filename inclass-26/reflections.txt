• What did you hope to learn but did not?
Get hand-on experience for using AWS or Azure

• What did you really enjoy learning about?
The cutting edge and fancy technologies like React, OAuth

• What worked well in the course? and how?
Divide and conquer strategy for the project. At first class when I knew the goal would be building a facebook-like website, 
I really didn't think I can make it. Though the task was tough, by dividing and conquering during the semester, I make it!

• What did not work well in the course and how might it be improved?
Sometimes the inclass excerise was a little bit difficult, and sometime the deadline conflicted with the homework, making it harder to finish.
So if the deadline of inclass excerise could move to next night, it could make life easier.

• What could I have done to help you more, presentation of material, design of in classexercises, goals of projects – and be specific please!
It would be great if we can do a peer evaluation on the final deliverable webapp, and maybe give some credits based on the rank of everyone's 
page. By doing that, we are encouraged to beautify pages and optimize user experience. Also if someone adopt new techniques and implement 
fancy features, he/she deserves some bonus credits. For example, this site, http://ethereal-clam.surge.sh/, (I saw this page when I did backend 
peer review), is using Materialize and feels fantastic, should get some rewards.
