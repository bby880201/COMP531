1. Which presentation was the most polished and delivered, and why?

I think Chao Zhou's presentation about hybrid mobile apps and Cordova 
is the most prepared one, since his presentation not only has content 
from wesite/community, but also from his own experience. Also in his 
presentation, he used some charts and data to prove his points, which
is a good way to illurstate points.

2. Which topic did you learn the most from and what did you learn?

Jinhao Ping's presentation about css frameworks. During this semester's
work on bootstrap, I really don't like it as he mentioned in his 
presentation that all website look similar. From his presentation, I 
know the existence of Semantic UI, which is more powerful for web
styling. I'm willing to have a try this library in the last homework.

3. Which talk did you like the best and why?
Chao Zhou's presentation. I like his presentation style.
