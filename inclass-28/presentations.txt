1. Which presentation was the most polished and delivered, and why?

I think Binhang's presentation about D3, Data-Driven Documents, is 
the most prepared one, since his presentation showed a lot of 
details for this library as well as gave several fancy examples.

2. Which topic did you learn the most from and what did you learn?

Also Binghuang's presentation, I've tried SVG graphing before, but 
didn't know d3 library. After his presentation, I learned a 
powerful tool that could draw very fancy plots on my website. It 
is a really cool technology. 

3. Which talk did you like the best and why?

I like presentation for vue.js best, since it gives many code 
pieces that could let me feel it intuitively.
